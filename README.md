# Adventure_Works_Project

## Scenario
Here, as a business intelligence analyst by Adventure Works,a fictional global manufacturing companythat produces cycling equipment and accessories. The Management team needs to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. We have Raw .csv files which contain returns, transactions, products, customers, and sales territories.

## Ask Phase

What are we trying to solve here?

* Connect and transform the raw data.
* Build a relationship.
* Create calculated columns and measures with DAX.
* Design an Interactive Dashboard to visualize the data.

  ## Prepare Phase

I have collected data from 11 .csv files, which includes data for customers products, return data, sales data from 2020 to 2022, Territories and product category as well. These fies were loaded to PowerBi for further analysis as required.


## Process Phase 

In this phase, we have checked data quality, and key profiling techniques like column distribution, and removed empty values, errors, and outliers. We have transformed tables using conditional columns, date/time tools, combining and modifying queries. We have created the date and territory hierarchies. We have created calculated columns and measures for better understanding. Nested functions etc where used  to find different customer with income categories etc.

## Analyze and Share Phase

Interactive Dashboard KPIs has been created to give an overall Idea of what is happening.
